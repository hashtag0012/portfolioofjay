Fix and refine the existing portfolio design with production-level standards.

CRITICAL FIXES (NON-NEGOTIABLE):

1. NAME TYPOGRAPHY
- The name “JAY” must always stay on a single line.
- Do NOT break letters across lines.
- Lock the word as one typographic unit.
- Maintain consistent kerning and spacing across all screen sizes.

2. PARALLAX & ANIMATIONS
- Remove heavy parallax effects.
- No animation should start mid-scroll or before the hero fully enters view.
- Animations must trigger only when elements enter the viewport.
- Prefer subtle fade, translate, or scale animations.
- Prioritize performance over visual gimmicks.
- Ensure zero scroll lag on low-end mobile devices.

3. HERO SECTION REFINEMENT
- Improve visual hierarchy: headline > subheadline > CTA.
- Make the hero more visually balanced and premium.
- Reduce noise, increase clarity.
- The hero must feel confident, not over-designed.

4. IMAGE & AVATAR FIXES (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Owner’s image must be properly centered and proportioned on mobile.
- No stretching, overflow, or awkward cropping.
- Maintain aspect ratio.
- Mobile view must look clean and intentional, not distorted or amateurish.

5. MOBILE-FIRST RESPONSIVENESS
- Redesign layouts starting from mobile, then scale up.
- Ensure clean spacing, readable typography, and correct alignment on:
  - Small phones
  - Large phones
  - Tablets
  - Laptops
  - Large desktops

6. BEAUTIFY ALL SECTIONS
- Improve visual consistency across the entire website.
- Services, work, about, and contact sections must feel part of one system.
- Use consistent spacing, card styles, colors, and motion.
- Remove any sections that feel empty, cluttered, or weak.

7. DESIGN QUALITY BAR
- No “template” or “demo” look.
- The site should feel like a high-end tech professional portfolio.
- Clean, modern, polished, and trustworthy.
- Visual appeal should support credibility, not distract from it.

8. PERFORMANCE & OPTIMIZATION
- Optimize images for fast loading.
- Minimize animation overhead.
- Ensure smooth scrolling on all devices.
- Lighthouse-friendly performance mindset.

FINAL GOAL:
A visually striking but performance-optimized, mobile-perfect, professional tech portfolio that looks intentional, credible, and premium on every device.
